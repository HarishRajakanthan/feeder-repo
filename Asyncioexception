That's a good question. Since the error occurs at the end of your code execution (rather than crashing your program), it's likely happening during cleanup or when a task is being finalized. Here's how you can identify where to catch the error:

### 1. Add a global exception handler for asyncio tasks

This solution will help you catch and identify unhandled exceptions in asyncio tasks:

```python
import asyncio
import traceback

# Add this near the start of your main script
def handle_task_exception(task):
    try:
        # This retrieves the exception if it exists
        task.result()
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass  # Task was cancelled, this is normal
    except Exception as e:
        # Print detailed information about the exception
        print(f"Task {task.get_name()} raised an exception: {e.__class__.__name__}: {e}")
        print(traceback.format_exc())

# Register the handler to run when tasks are done
asyncio.get_event_loop().set_exception_handler(lambda loop, context: 
    print(f"Asyncio exception: {context['message']}\n"
          f"Exception: {context.get('exception')}\n"
          f"Task: {context.get('task')}\n"
          f"Future: {context.get('future')}"))
```

### 2. Find the specific task causing the error

Once you know which task is causing the issue, you can wrap that specific operation with a try/except block. If it's happening during Playwright's cleanup, wrap your Playwright context manager:

```python
async def run_playwright():
    try:
        async with async_playwright() as p:
            # Your Playwright code
            pass
    except NotImplementedError as e:
        # This will catch the error during Playwright cleanup
        print(f"Suppressed NotImplementedError: {e}")

# Call this function instead of using async_playwright directly
```

### 3. Look for pending tasks at shutdown

The error might be in a dangling task. Add this code before your program exits:

```python
async def main():
    # Your existing code
    
    # Before exiting, check for pending tasks
    tasks = [t for t in asyncio.all_tasks() if t is not asyncio.current_task()]
    for task in tasks:
        try:
            print(f"Cancelling task: {task.get_name()}")
            task.cancel()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error cancelling task {task.get_name()}: {e}")

    # Wait for all tasks to complete with a timeout
    if tasks:
        await asyncio.wait(tasks, timeout=5)
```

### 4. Inspect the specific error location in your code

Based on your traceback, the error is in `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec()`. If you're using this function directly in your code, wrap those specific calls in try/except:

```python
async def run_subprocess():
    try:
        # If you're calling create_subprocess_exec somewhere
        proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(...)
    except NotImplementedError:
        # Handle or suppress the error
        print("Subprocess creation not implemented on this platform")
```

Would any of these approaches work for your codebase? If you can share a bit more about the structure of your code, I can provide more specific guidance.
