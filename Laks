I apologize for the oversight. You’re right—my final SQL query for Option 1 didn’t fully reconstruct the WHERE clause correctly, particularly in handling the top-level conditions in condition_group = 0 and ensuring the precedence of OR and AND aligns with the original query. The output included unnecessary parentheses and didn’t properly sequence the top-level conditions. Let’s fix this by revisiting the query and ensuring it matches the exact structure of:WHERE (department = 'HR' AND (salary > 50000 OR SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 3) = 'Joh')) OR UPPER(last_name) LIKE '%SMITH%' AND age < 40Issues in the Previous QueryTop-Level Precedence: The TopLevelPrecedence CTE split condition_group = 0 into OR and AND parts incorrectly, adding extra parentheses and not respecting the sequence (OR followed by AND).Trailing Connectors: The aggregation didn’t properly trim or handle logical_connector values, leading to an incorrect final string.Nesting Logic: While the nesting worked, the top-level combination didn’t reflect the query’s flat structure after the nested part.Corrected ApproachFor Option 1:condition_group = 0 contains the top-level conditions (UPPER(last_name) LIKE '%SMITH%' and age < 40), sequenced by condition_order.We need to:Build nested groups (1 and 2) with proper parentheses.Append the top-level conditions from group 0 in order, respecting logical_connector values and SQL precedence (AND binds tighter than OR).Sample Data (Option 1)sql_idsql_namecondition_groupparent_groupcondition_ordercolumn_nameoperatorvaluefunction_namelogical_connector1emp_query1NULL1department='HR'NULLAND1emp_query211salary>50000NULLOR1emp_query212first_name='Joh'SUBSTR(1, 3)NULL1emp_query0NULL1last_nameLIKE'%SMITH%'UPPEROR1emp_query0NULL2age<40NULLANDCorrected SQL QueryWITH RECURSIVE Conditions AS (

The NestedGroups CTE adds parentheses around full_text for nested groups.Top-Level Conditions:Group 0 conditions are appended as a flat sequence without additional parentheses, relying on condition_order and logical_connector to maintain the structure.No extra parentheses are needed around UPPER(last_name) LIKE '%SMITH%' or age < 40 because they’re not explicitly grouped in the original query—precedence (AND over OR) is implicit in SQL evaluation.VerificationMatches the original: (nested group) OR condition AND condition.Precedence: The AND between UPPER(last_name) LIKE '%SMITH%' and age < 40 binds them together, applying to the OR-ed result of the nested group, which SQL handles naturally.If this still doesn’t align with your expectations, please let me know what specific part is off, and I’ll refine it further!
